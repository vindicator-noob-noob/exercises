Hello everyone! I'm very new to Python and GitHub. I'm hoping by joining this community I can become more immersed into programing 
and pick up some advice from seasoned coders, along some terminology and common practices. 
Looking forward to viewing your work, and reading your thoughts!

# exercises
This repository consists of exercises and my solutions (as a beginner). Looking for refined advice for more experienced coders.
